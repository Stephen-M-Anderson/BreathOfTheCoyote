# Breath Of The Coyote
My friends and I created this game to participate in a 10 week video game design competition at California State University San Bernardino. This project is created in Unity and takes advantage of the lightweight render pipeline and both the Shader graph and the new visual effects graph. Using this technology, we were not only able to make a working game, but we were also able to get first place in the competition.
